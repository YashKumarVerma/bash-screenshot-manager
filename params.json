{"name":"Bash Screenshot Manager","tagline":"simple bash script to manage quick screenshots taken during online class and systematically store them.","body":"# Screenshot Manager\r\n\r\nIt's COVID ! As organizations have started online sessions, there would be (millions and millions) of instances when you would want to quickly take a screenshot for later reference. If (like me) you also face difficulty in referring to the old screenshots from a list of 300-400 images, then this script is for you.\r\n\r\nThis would automatically categorize and arrange your screenshots based on time and topic.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n- Download / copy the contents `screenshot-manager.sh` to your screenshots directory.\r\n- Run `chmod +x screenshot-manager.sh` to grant execution permissions\r\n- Done.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n**make sure that the script is located in your screenshots folder**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# after attending data structures and algorithms class, run this\r\n./screenshot-manager.sh dsa\r\n\r\n# after attending data structures and algorithms lab, run this\r\n./screenshot-manager.sh dsa --lab\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Attention\r\n\r\n- the code that you enter as a parameter depicts your subject code. Try keeping it short,for example: DBMS, OS, DSA etc.\r\n- Since screenshots are bundled based on course names, entering same long names would become difficult and boring (and useless as well).\r\n- If not specified, the class is assumed to be a theory class, for lab classes, specify a `--lab` flag\r\n- Clean up the screenshot directory before using this command, else all those would be moved to the subject screenshots.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\n- If you are a beginner, try playing around with the variables given at the start of the script. They're kept there only for you.\r\n- If you are not a beginner, you know what all you can do.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n- **Yash Kumar Verma**\r\n\r\n  - LinkedIn: [yash-kumar-verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-kumar-verma/)\r\n  - Stackoverflow: [yash-kumar-verma](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5131640/yash-kumar-verma?tab=profile)\r\n  - ![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/yash_kr_verma?style=social)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
